**MotorControl**:
- Memoized button states and click handlers
- Optimized loading state management
- Cached status display calculations

**IrrigationHistoryCard**:
- Memoized event filtering and sorting
- Optimized pagination with display count
- Cached source icon and label mappings

**NextSchedule**:
- Optimized schedule calculation algorithm
- Memoized next schedule determination
- Fixed property name inconsistencies (frequency vs isDaily)

### Code Quality Improvements
âœ… **TypeScript Compliance**: Fixed all type errors and inconsistencies
âœ… **Import Optimization**: Removed unused imports and optimized bundle size
âœ… **Code Structure**: Improved component composition and separation of concerns
âœ… **Error Boundaries**: Enhanced error handling throughout the application

## ðŸ“Š Performance Benefits

### Expected Improvements:

- **Memory Usage**: Optimized data structures reduce memory footprint
- **Error Recovery**: Enhanced error handling improves system stability

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### React Performance Patterns Used:
1. **React.memo**: Component memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. **useMemo**: Expensive calculation caching (filtering, sorting, formatting)
3. **useCallback**: Function memoization for event handlers
4. **Optimized Dependencies**: Careful dependency array management
5. **Component Composition**: Efficient prop passing and state management

### Backend Async Patterns:
1. **Async/Await**: Modern promise handling throughout
2. **Debouncing**: Rate-limited file operations
3. **Batch Processing**: Grouped MQTT operations
4. **Connection Pooling**: Optimized MQTT client management

## ðŸŽ¯ Development Best Practices Implemented

- **Performance First**: All components optimized for minimal re-renders
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with proper typing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and logging
- **Code Reusability**: Modular component design with clear interfaces
- **Maintainability**: Clean code structure with optimized imports

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Further Optimization

### Potential Future Enhancements:
1. **Bundle Analysis**: Use webpack-bundle-analyzer to identify large dependencies
2. **Code Splitting**: Implement lazy loading for route-based components
3. **Service Worker**: Add offline capability and caching strategies
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Integrate real-time performance metrics
5. **Database Optimization**: Consider caching layer for frequent queries

### Monitoring Recommendations:
- Monitor bundle size changes over time
- Track component render frequency in development
- Use React DevTools Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks
- Implement performance budgets for CI/CD
