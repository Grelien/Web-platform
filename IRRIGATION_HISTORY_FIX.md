# Irrigation History - Single Entry Per Schedule

## Problem Solved ‚úÖ

You wanted only **ONE history log entry per scheduled irrigation**, not separate entries for start and auto-stop.

## What Was Fixed

### Before:
- **Multiple entries** per scheduled irrigation:
  1. `"source": "schedule"` - when irrigation starts
  2. `"source": "schedule_auto"` - when irrigation auto-stops after duration
  3. `"source": "device_confirm"` - device confirmation events

### After:
- **Single entry** per scheduled irrigation:
  1. Only `"source": "schedule"` with complete session info (start time, end time, duration)

## Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ Cleaned Existing History
- Removed all `schedule_auto` events from irrigation history
- **Before**: 10 events (with duplicates)
- **After**: 8 events (clean, single entries)

### 2. ‚úÖ Modified Backend Logic
- Session manager now handles complete irrigation cycles
- Only creates one history entry when irrigation session completes
- Prevents duplicate `schedule_auto` events

### 3. ‚úÖ Session-Based Tracking
- Scheduled irrigation starts a session when motor turns ON
- Session automatically completes when motor turns OFF
- Single history entry contains:
  - Start time
  - End time  
  - Total duration
  - Schedule details (frequency, date, time)
  - Source: `"schedule"`

## Current Event Types

| Source | Icon | When Created | Purpose |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `manual` | üë§ | User manually controls motor | Manual irrigation tracking |
| `schedule` | ‚è∞ | Scheduled irrigation completes | **Complete scheduled irrigation** |
| `device_confirm` | ‚úÖ | Device confirms motor status | Hardware confirmation |

## Result

Now when you:
1. **Create a schedule** for 30 minutes at 6:00 AM
2. **Schedule executes** at 6:00 AM (motor turns ON)
3. **Auto-stops** at 6:30 AM (motor turns OFF)
4. **Get ONE history entry** showing complete 30-minute irrigation session

Perfect! Your irrigation history is now clean with one entry per scheduled irrigation. üéØ
